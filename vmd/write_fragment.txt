So you want to extract a fragment and save it to a file?

1) Open the system in VMD

    vmd -pdb whatever.pdb    , or
    vmd whatever.xyz

2) Make the selection that gets you the fragment

    set sel [atomselect top "within 6 of index 5418 or within 2 of index 5264 or within 2 of index 5154"]     , or e.g.
    set sel [atomselect top]

3) save it to file

    $sel writexyz yay.xyz     , or
    $sel writepdb yay.pdb
