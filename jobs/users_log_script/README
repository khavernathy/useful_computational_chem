Put this in your ~/.bashrc

alias yellgraph='bash /work/d/dfranz/useful_computational_chem/whocaniyellat.sh >> /work/d/dfranz/yell_log_data/yell_log.log; while sleep 600; do bash /work/d/dfranz/useful_computational_chem/whocaniyellat.sh >> /work/d/dfranz/yell_log_data/yell_log.log; echo "output to yell log at "$(date); done'


sleep 600 means wait 10 minutes for every writeout.
Note the directory/filename should be your own.
Also the whocaniyellat.sh script location should be your own. (whocaniyellat.sh is in the root dir of this github  thing)


Use this to view graph

bash viewgraph.sh
